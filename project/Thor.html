<h1>Thor Peak is like no other mountain on earth. Its precipitous west face is known 'round the world in climbing circles and is the one mountain most often associated with Auyuittuq by visitors. The Inuit refer to Thor as 'Qaisualuk' as the mountains of Auyuittuq (the Penny Highlands) have an important role in the lives of the people of Baffin Island. Like Asgard, Thor takes its name from Norse mythology named after the mighty god of thunder who with mjolnir in hand controlled the winds and raged against the frost giants.</h1>
