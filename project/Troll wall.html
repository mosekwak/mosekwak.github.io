      <h1>One of Romsdal's rock faces in particular catches every climber's eye: The Troll Wall, a huge cliff which rises vertically for over 3500 feet. The rock is gneiss and bears little resemblance to the solid granite of Yosemite. The Troll wall sees only a little morning sun; even in summer, ice fills the cracks on this north facing wall. The rock is featured, but generally not solid, and continual rockfall is the norm. Snow and ice on ledges and features melt on the warmer days increasing rockfall and necessitate climbing sections of wet rock on most routes. Routefinding is a major challenge on most routes, as is the weather: the storms that move in frequently all year around are serious: drizzle turns to sleet, and falling ice and slippery conditions cause serious objective hazards.</h1>
