   <h1>The full name of this mountain is Tsingy de Bemaraha. It is located in Western Madagascar. It is about 666 square kilometers wide. The limestone rocks known as the tsingy were formed by a deposit of fossils and seashells under the sea 200 million years ago when thick layers of calcite at the bottom of the lagoon formed a thick limestone bed.</h1>
